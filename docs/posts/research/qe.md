# Advancing Quantitative Economics: QuantEcon

Collaborating with the esteemed professors [Dr. Thomas J. Sargent](http://www.tomsargent.com/) and
[Dr. John Stachurski](https://johnstachurski.net/) for my M.Tech thesis on the Quantitative Economics at the [QuantEcon Labs](https://quantecon.org/), was a transformative experience that
enriched both my academic journey and professional growth. This all started
as I was very curious to learn more about economics and contributing to
[QuantEcon.py](https://quantecon.org/quantecon-py/).

I was one of the **founding members** of a comprehensive lecture series tailored for
[undergraduates](https://intro.quantecon.org/intro.html), along with [Google JAX lectures](https://jax.quantecon.org/intro.html) focusing on quantitative
economics and open science. These initiatives were crafted with precision to enhance
learning experiences, bridging theoretical concepts with practical
applications in the landscape of quantitative economics.

In parallel, I undertook the role of authoring Python code examples for
the [Dynamic Programming Book](https://dp.quantecon.org/), meticulously
optimizing solutions for complex economic models.

Beyond academic pursuits, I embraced leadership opportunities by preparing
grant proposals and advocating for QuantEcon initiatives at [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/).
Through proactive engagement, I sought to amplify the impact of
QuantEcon's mission, garnering support and recognition on a global scale.
