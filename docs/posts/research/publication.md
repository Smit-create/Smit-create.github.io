## CNN based lossy compression of hyperspectral images

**Paper**: [Convolution neural network based lossy compression of hyperspectral images
](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0923596521001028)

The paper proposes a lossy hyperspectral image compression
algorithm using autoencoders. It employs convolution and max-pooling
layers to reduce image dimensions, generating a compressed version.
Reconstruction is done using transpose convolution layers. The compressed
image is entropy coded for storage or transmission. The method improves
PSNR by 28% and increases compression ratio by 21 times. Classification
accuracy is minimally affected, validating algorithm effectiveness.

## QuantEcon[.]py

**Paper**: [QuantEcon.py: A community based Python library for quantitative economics](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.05585.pdf)

Economics traditionally used simple methods for analysis, but recent
trends demand computational solutions for complex, nonlinear problems.
QuantEcon[.]py, an open-source Python library since 2014, supports this
shift by offering a suite of tools for economic analysis. Developed for 9
years, it includes functions for numerical methods, data visualization,
estimation, and dynamic programming. This article reviews its key
features, showcasing its vital role in high-performance computational
economics.

## Dynamic Programming

**Book**: [Dynamic Programming](https://dp.quantecon.org/)

This book is about dynamic programming and its applications in economics,
finance, and adjacent fields like operations research. It brings together
recent innovations in the theory of dynamic programming and also provides
related applications and computer code.

I undertook the role of writing Python code examples and meticulously
optimizing solutions for complex economic models
