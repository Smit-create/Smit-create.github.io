# Introduction

Hello there!

I'm **Smit Lunagariya**, a Software Engineer currently making waves at the tech giant, **Google**.

My exhilarating journey in the realm of software engineering commenced
with a bang when I clinched a coveted spot in the Google Summer of Code
program back in 2020. Since then, there's been no looking back!
My heart was instantly captured by the captivating world of open source,
and I've been joyfully contributing to an array of groundbreaking projects such as [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), [LPython](https://github.com/lcompilers/lpython), [LFortran](https://lfortran.org/), [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/),
[Aesara](https://aesara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and the list goes on!

Driven by an insatiable passion for *high-performance computing*, *scientific computing*, *optimization*, *compilers*, and *machine learning*, I find myself constantly on a quest for innovation and
excellence.

But life isn't just about coding and algorithms for me! I also thrive on adventure and exploration.
I'm always up for new experiences that enrich both the mind and the soul.

Let's shape the future together. ðŸš€
