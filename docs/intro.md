# Introduction

Hello there!

I'm **Smit Lunagariya**, a Software Engineer currently working at **Google**.

My exhilarating journey in the realm of software engineering commenced
when I clinched a  spot in the Google Summer of Code
program back in 2020. Since then, there's been no looking back!
I was instantly captured by the captivating world of open source,
and I've been contributing to an array of groundbreaking projects such as [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), [LPython](https://github.com/lcompilers/lpython), [LFortran](https://lfortran.org/), [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/),
[Aesara](https://aesara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and the list goes on!

I am always passionate for *high-performance computing*, *scientific
computing*, *optimization*, *compilers*, and *machine learning*, and I
find myself constantly on a quest for innovation and
excellence.

Let's shape the future together. ðŸš€
